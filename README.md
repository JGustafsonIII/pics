# Modern React with Redux Course Project

The objective of this project was to develop an understanding of api requests in react, using refs rather then query selectors along with breaking the project down into smaller components.

## Starting the application

If you want to mess around with the application then start by running `git clone https://github.com/JGustafsonIII/pics.git`. This will clone the repository to your local machine. After you clone the project to your local machine you can open a terminal there and run `cd pics && npm install`. This will change your current working directory to the projects and then install all of the projects dependecies. After it finishes installing you `npm start` and then the project will open in your browser at localhost:3000.
